Users of HTML are sometimes suprised to find that HTML gives them little control over the way
that a page is displpayed. <br> It shouble be remembered that HTML was developed as a means of marking 
up the structure of a document not as a way of determining its presentation. <p> Formatting text to
appear on Web page is tehrefore different from formatting text to appear </p>p> in printed document.
